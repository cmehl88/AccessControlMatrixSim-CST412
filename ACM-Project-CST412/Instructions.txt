How to run program:
When running the program you are greeted with a menu to choose from.
First load the input acm list being option 1. For the default starter acm file it's input-acm-entries.txt. Without anything loaded nothing will be able to be changed.
Then after you have inputted your starter acm list up to you what to do with the next options as theres no order needed.
I suggest after loading to print to formiliarize yourself with the format.
An ideal step through would be 1, load the acm, 2, make sure it looks correct, 3 update the list, 4 evaluate the new list but again no certain order required.
